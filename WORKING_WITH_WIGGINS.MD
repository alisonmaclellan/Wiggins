# Working with Wiggins

This document captures how I collaborate with **Wiggins**.

It is not a set of rules for a tool. It is a reminder of *how I want to think* when I'm working.

## What Wiggins Is

Wiggins is a thinking partner.

- Helps me reason through problems
- Helps me find clearer language
- Helps surface alternatives I may not have considered
- Helps me slow down when precision matters
- Helps me move faster when momentum is right

Wiggins does **not** make decisions for me.
Judgment, taste, and responsibility remain mine.

## How I Work Best with Wiggins

I get the most value when I:

- Start with half-formed thoughts, not polished questions
- Ask for exploration rather than answers
- Invite pushback and reframing
- Iterate instead of expecting a perfect first response
- Treat the interaction as dialogue, not a transaction

If I'm only asking for output, I'm probably underusing the collaboration.

## Signals I'm Over-Delegating

If I notice these patterns, it's a cue to pause and re-center on collaboration rather than delegation:

- I'm asking Wiggins to *decide* instead of to help me think
- I'm pasting fully formed instructions and skipping exploration
- I'm optimizing for speed at the expense of understanding
- I'm accepting answers without questioning or reframing them
- I'm treating responses as final rather than as drafts
- I feel relieved to offload responsibility instead of clearer about taking it

When this happens, the reset is simple:

- Step back to intent
- Share uncertainty
- Ask for alternatives and trade-offs
- Reassert that the final call is mine

---

## What Wiggins Is Not

- Not an authority
- Not a decision maker
- Not a replacement for my voice
- Not a shortcut around thinking

Wiggins is here to *support* thinking, not bypass it.

## Why Naming the Collaboration Matters

Naming the collaboration makes it visible.

It reminds me that:

- Good work often happens in conversation
- Even text-based collaboration benefits from intention
- How I show up affects what I get back

Naming is not about anthropomorphizing software.
It is about being deliberate in how I work.

## Reset Prompt (Optional)

When I'm starting something important, I may begin with:

Wiggins, help me think this through.
I want clarity, alternatives, and honest pushback.
I'll make the final call.

---

## Context

- Wiggins, let’s set context.
- I want help thinking, not deciding.
- Please challenge assumptions, offer alternatives, and help me find clearer language.
- I’ll make the final call.

## Evolution Log

This section captures how my collaboration with Wiggins evolves over time.
The intent is to notice changes in *how* I work, not to document features or outcomes.

- **2026-01-28** — Created the initial *Working with Wiggins* document. Clarified Wiggins as a thinking partner rather than a decision maker. Named the collaboration intentionally to make the way I work visible and deliberate.
- **2026-01-28** — Added explicit signals for over-delegation. Noted that the key risk is optimizing for speed over understanding and offloading responsibility instead of gaining clarity.
- **2026-01-30** — Added a *Context* section with a reusable prompt for setting the collaboration frame at the start of a session. Reinforces the intent to think together rather than delegate decisions.

Future entries should be small, honest adjustments that reflect real shifts in practice.

**Template for new entries:**

- **YYYY-MM-DD** — *Shift noticed.* What changed in how I was working.
  *Adjustment made.* What I'm doing differently now.
  *Why it mattered.* The impact on clarity, ownership, or collaboration.

## Change Control

If this document changes, it should be because my way of working has changed.

This is a living note, not a manifesto.
