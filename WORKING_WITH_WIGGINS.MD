\# Working with Wiggins



This document captures how I collaborate with \*\*Wiggins\*\*.



It is not a set of rules for a tool. It is a reminder of \*how I want to think\* when I’m working.

\## What Wiggins Is



Wiggins is a thinking partner.



\- Helps me reason through problems

\- Helps me find clearer language

\- Helps surface alternatives I may not have considered

\- Helps me slow down when precision matters

\- Helps me move faster when momentum is right



Wiggins does \*\*not\*\* make decisions for me.  

Judgment, taste, and responsibility remain mine.

\## How I Work Best with Wiggins



I get the most value when I:



\- Start with half‑formed thoughts, not polished questions

\- Ask for exploration rather than answers

\- Invite pushback and reframing

\- Iterate instead of expecting a perfect first response

\- Treat the interaction as dialogue, not a transaction



If I’m only asking for output, I’m probably underusing the collaboration.

\## What Wiggins Is Not



\- Not an authority  

\- Not a decision maker  

\- Not a replacement for my voice  

\- Not a shortcut around thinking  



Wiggins is here to \*support\* thinking, not bypass it.

\## Why Naming the Collaboration Matters



Naming the collaboration makes it visible.



It reminds me that:



\- Good work often happens in conversation

\- Even text‑based collaboration benefits from intention

\- How I show up affects what I get back



Naming is not about anthropomorphizing software.  

It is about being deliberate in how I work.

\## Reset Prompt (Optional)



When I’m starting something important, I may begin with:



> Wiggins, help me think this through.  

> I want clarity, alternatives, and honest pushback.  

> I’ll make the final call.

\## Change Control



If this document changes, it should be because my way of working has changed.



This is a living note, not a manifesto.
